            its distinctive art styles, diverse genres, and compelling storytelling. Originating in the early 20th

                <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Origins and Evolution</h2>

                <li style="font-size: 25px;">Anime, short for " animation," has roots dating back to the early 1900s,
                    with early influences from
                    Western animation. However, it was not until the post-World War II era that anime began to develop
                    its unique identity. The 1960s marked a significant turning point with the creation of iconic series
                    like "Astro Boy" by Osamu Tezuka, often referred to as the "God of Manga." Tezuka's work laid the
                    foundation for modern anime, introducing serialized storytelling and complex characters.</li>
                <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Artistic Style and Themes</h2>
                <li style="font-size: 25px;">One of the defining characteristics of anime is its artistic style. Anime
                    features vibrant
                    colors, exaggerated facial expressions, and distinctive character designs, often with large,
                    expressive eyes. This unique aesthetic sets it apart from other forms of animation. Anime
                    explores a wide range of themes and genres, from science fiction and fantasy to romance and
                    horror. This diversity allows it to appeal to various age groups and interests.</li>
                <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Cultural Impact</h2>
                <li style="font-size: 25px;">Anime is deeply ingrained in Japanese culture, reflecting societal values,
                    historical events,
                    and contemporary issues. It serves as a medium for creators to express their perspectives and
                    critique social norms. For instance, series like "Neon Genesis Evangelion" delve into
                    psychological and existential themes, while "Attack on Titan" explores ideas of freedom and
                    oppression.

                    Beyond Japan, anime has a significant cultural impact globally. It has influenced Western
                    animation, inspired countless fan conventions, and created a dedicated fanbase known as "otaku."
                    Anime's popularity has also led to the global success of Japanese video games, music, and
                    fashion.</li>
                <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Major Contributions and Icons</h2>
                <li style="font-size: 25px;">Several anime series and films have achieved legendary status and are
                    considered essential
                    viewing. Studio Ghibli, founded by Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata, is renowned for its
                    beautifully animated films such as "Spirited Away," "My Neighbor Totoro," and "Princess
                    Mononoke." These films are celebrated for their enchanting storytelling, environmental themes,
                    and intricate animation.

                    Another significant contribution to the anime world is the long-running series "One Piece,"
                    created by Eiichiro Oda. As one of the best-selling manga and anime series of all time, it
                    showcases the adventurous spirit and imaginative world-building that anime is known for.</li>
                <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Future of Anime</h2>
                <li style="font-size: 25px;">The future of anime looks promising, with advancements in technology and
                    increasing
                    international collaborations. Streaming platforms like Netflix and Crunchyroll have made anime
                    more accessible to global audiences, fostering a new generation of fans. Additionally, the use
                    of CGI and other modern techniques is expanding the boundaries of what anime can achieve
